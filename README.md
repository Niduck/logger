# IDEAS

Create a group property which can be log in the console or displayed directly in the body :

> > > The groups are shown at the bottom of the page as snacks and the group content is displayed on click.
> > > The group content is displayed with a low opacity and point-events:none; while CTRL or ALT are not pressed.
> > > the idea is to take inspiration from video games.
